# GCase
Covariance matrices for GCase MD simulations.

Covariance matricies can be used to determine dynamic information such as DFI and DCI.

Matricies are located in .rar files corresponding to each tested variant, with "cleaned" indicating the wild type.

Matricies each cover as 50ns window, and are provided in intervals of 25ns, leaving 25ns of overlap from one file to the next.

The names of the covariance matricies within the .rar files inticate the time (in tens of picoseconds).
